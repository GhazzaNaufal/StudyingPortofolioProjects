ðŸ’¡ Exploring COVID-19 Data with SQL Server ðŸ’¡ 

Recently,i worked on my first SQL Server project by analyzing COVID-19 data. I performed various SQL queries to uncover insights, such as:

ðŸ“ŒCountries with the Highest Death Count per Population
-The United States recorded the highest total deaths: 576,232 
(Jan 22, 2020 - Apr 30, 2021).
-Indonesia rangked 18th, with 45,521 deaths (Mar 2, 2020 - Apr 30, 2021).

ðŸ“Œ Global Trends
-Analyzed the infection rate per country based on total cases vs population.
-Explored the relationship between vaccination rates and COVID-19 cases.

This project helped me understand data manipulation,flitering,aggeregation,and JOIN operations in SQL Server.
